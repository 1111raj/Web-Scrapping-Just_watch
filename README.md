**Data Cleaning and Manipulation**

Post-scraping, data cleaning and manipulation techniques are applied to enhance the data's quality and usability. Key techniques include:
•	Removing duplicates to ensure unique entries.
•	Handling missing/null values for completeness.
•	Standardizing text fields, such as converting titles to title case.
•	Extracting relevant information, e.g., genres from descriptions.
•	Normalizing data, such as converting dates into a standardized format.
These processes can be implemented directly within the justwatch_scraper.py script or using separate preprocessing scripts, depending on the complexity of the cleaning tasks.
